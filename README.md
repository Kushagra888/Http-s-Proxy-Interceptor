## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kushagra888/Http-s-Proxy-Interceptor.git
   cd Http-s-Proxy-Interceptor
   ```

2. No additional dependencies required! The project uses only Python standard libraries.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Start the proxy server:
   ```bash
   cd PythonProxyServer
   python main.py
   ```

2. The GUI will appear and the proxy will start listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`

3. Configure your browser to use the proxy:

   **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Search for "proxy" ‚Üí Open system proxy settings
   - Manual proxy setup:
     - Address: `127.0.0.1`
     - Port: `8080`

   **Firefox:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Network Settings
   - Manual proxy configuration:
     - HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1`
     - Port: `8080`
     - Check "Also use this proxy for HTTPS"

4. Test the proxy:
   - Visit http://example.com or http://neverssl.com
   - Watch the requests appear in the GUI
   - Use the buttons to:
     - "Forward to Server": Send request to target server
     - "Forward to Client": Send response back to browser
     - "Drop": Discard the request

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Best suited for HTTP traffic inspection
- For HTTPS, you may see certificate warnings (normal for proxy interceptors)
- Remember to disable proxy settings in your browser after testing
- Default proxy address: `127.0.0.1:8080`
